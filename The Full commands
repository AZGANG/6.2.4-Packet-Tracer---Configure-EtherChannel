Configure EtherChannel....
On S1 and S3, add ports F0/21 and F0/22 to Port Channel 1 with the channel-group 1 mode desirable command. The mode desirable option enables the switch to actively negotiate to form a PAgP link. Note: Interfaces must be shutdown before adding them to the channel group.

Port Channel 2 is not operative because Spanning Tree Protocol placed some ports into blocking mode. Unfortunately, those ports were the Gigabit ports
"spanning-tree vlan 1 root active" to fix that
