# 6.2.4-Packet-Tracer---Configure-EtherChannel
Configure EtherChannel
Packet Tracer - Configure EtherChannel

Objectives
Part 1: Configure Basic Switch Settings

Part 2: Configure an EtherChannel with Cisco PAgP

Part 3: Configure an 802.3ad LACP EtherChannel

Part 4: Configure a Redundant EtherChannel Link

Background
Three switches have just been installed. There are redundant uplinks between the switches. As configured, only one of these links can be used; otherwise, a bridging loop might occur. However, using only one link utilizes only half of the available bandwidth. EtherChannel allows up to eight redundant links to be bundled together into one logical link. In this lab, you will configure Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP), a Cisco EtherChannel protocol, and Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP), an IEEE 802.3ad open standard version of EtherChannel.

Before beginning the configuration, review the EtherChannel Configuration Guidelines and Restrictions listed at the end of this activity.
